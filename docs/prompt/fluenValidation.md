# Other Advanced Features

These features are not normally used in day-to-day use, but provide some additional extensibility points that may be useful in some circumstances.

## PreValidate

If you need to run specific code every time a validator is invoked, you can do this by overriding the `PreValidate` method. This method takes a `ValidationContext` as well as a `ValidationResult`, which you can use to customise the validation process.

The method should return `true` if validation should continue, or `false` to immediately abort. Any modifications that you made to the `ValidationResult` will be returned to the user.

Note that this method is called before FluentValidation performs its standard null-check against the model being validated, so you can use this to generate an error if the whole model is null, rather than relying on FluentValidation's standard behaviour in this case (which is to throw an exception):

```csharp
public class MyValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public MyValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotNull();
  }

  protected override bool PreValidate(ValidationContext<Person> context, ValidationResult result) 
  {
    if (context.InstanceToValidate == null) 
    {
      result.Errors.Add(new ValidationFailure("", "Please ensure a model was supplied."));
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Root Context Data

For advanced users, it's possible to pass arbitrary data into the validation pipeline that can be accessed from within custom property validators. This is particularly useful if you need to make a conditional decision based on arbitrary data not available within the object being validated, as validators are stateless.

The `RootContextData` property is a `Dictionary<string, object>` available on the `ValidationContext`.:

```csharp
var person = new Person();
var context = new ValidationContext<Person>(person);
context.RootContextData["MyCustomData"] = "Test";
var validator = new PersonValidator();
validator.Validate(context);
```

The RootContextData can then be accessed inside any custom property validators, as well as calls to `Custom`:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).Custom((x, context) => 
{
  if(context.RootContextData.ContainsKey("MyCustomData")) 
  {
    context.AddFailure("My error message");
  }
});
```

## Customizing the Validation Exception

If you use the `ValidateAndThrow` method to [throw an exception when validation fails](start.html#throwing-exceptions) FluentValidation will internally throw a `ValidationException`. You can customzie this behaviour so a different exception is thrown by overriding the `RaiseValidationException` in your validator. 

This simplistic example wraps the default `ValidationException` in an `ArgumentException` instead:

```csharp
protected override void RaiseValidationException(ValidationContext<T> context, ValidationResult result)
{
    var ex = new ValidationException(result.Errors);
    throw new ArgumentException(ex.Message, ex);
}
```

This approach is useful if you always want to throw a specific custom exception type every time `ValidateAndThrow` is invoked.

As an alternative you could create your own extension method that calls `Validate` and then throws your own custom exception if there are validation errors. 


```csharp
public static class FluentValidationExtensions
{
    public static void ValidateAndThrowArgumentException<T>(this IValidator<T> validator, T instance)
    {
        var res = validator.Validate(instance);

        if (!res.IsValid)
        {
            var ex = new ValidationException(res.Errors);
            throw new ArgumentException(ex.Message, ex);
        }
    }
}
```

This approach is more useful if you only want to throw the custom exception when your specific method is invoked, rather than any time `ValidateAndThrow` is invoked.


## aspnet.md

# ASP.NET Core

FluentValidation can be used within ASP.NET Core web applications to validate incoming models. There are several approaches for doing this: 

- Manual validation
- Automatic validation (using the ASP.NET validation pipeline)
- Automatic validation (using a filter)

With manual validation, you inject the validator into your controller (or api endpoint), invoke the validator and act upon the result. This is the most straightforward approach and also the easiest to see what's happening. 

With automatic validation, FluentValidation is invoked automatically by ASP.NET earlier in the pipeline which allows models to be validated before a controller action is invoked. 

## Getting started

The following examples will make use of a `Person` object which is validated using a `PersonValidator`. These classes are defined as follows:

```csharp
public class Person 
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Email { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Id).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).Length(0, 10);
    RuleFor(x => x.Email).EmailAddress();
    RuleFor(x => x.Age).InclusiveBetween(18, 60);
  }
}
```

If you're using MVC, Web Api or Razor Pages you'll need to register your validator with the Service Provider in the `ConfigureServices` method of your application's `Startup` class. (note that if you're using Minimal APIs, [see the section on Minimal APIs below](aspnet.html#minimal-apis)). 

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) 
{
    // If you're using MVC or WebApi you'll probably have
    // a call to AddMvc() or AddControllers() already.
    services.AddMvc();
    
    // ... other configuration ...
    
    services.AddScoped<IValidator<Person>, PersonValidator>();
}
```

Here we register our `PersonValidator` with the service provider by calling `AddScoped`.

```eval_rst
.. note::
  Note that you must register each validator as `IValidator<T>` where `T` is the type being validated. So if you have a `PersonValidator` that inherits from `AbstractValidator<Person>` then you should register it as `IValidator<Person>`
```

Alternatively you can register all validators in a specific assembly by using our Service Collection extensions. To do this you'll need to install the `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions` package and then call the appropriate `AddValidators...` extension method on the services collection. [See this page for more details](di.html#automatic-registration)

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) 
{
    services.AddMvc();

    // ... other configuration ...

    services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<PersonValidator>();
}
```

Here we use the `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining` method from the `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtension` package to automatically register all validators in the same assembly as `PersonValidator` with the service provider.

Now that the validators are registered with the service provider you can start working with either manual validation or automatic validation.

```eval_rst
.. note::
   The auto-registration method used above uses reflection to scan one or more assemblies for validators. An alternative approach would be to use a source generator such as `AutoRegisterInject <https://github.com/patrickklaeren/AutoRegisterInject>`_ to set up registrations. 
```

## Manual Validation

With the manual validation approach, you'll inject the validator into your controller (or Razor page) and invoke it against the model.

For example, you might have a controller that looks like this:

```csharp
public class PeopleController : Controller 
{
  private IValidator<Person> _validator;
  private IPersonRepository _repository;

  public PeopleController(IValidator<Person> validator, IPersonRepository repository) 
  {
    // Inject our validator and also a DB context for storing our person object.
    _validator = validator;
    _repository = repository;
  }

  public ActionResult Create() 
  {
    return View();
  }

  [HttpPost]
  public async Task<IActionResult> Create(Person person) 
  {
    ValidationResult result = await _validator.ValidateAsync(person);

    if (!result.IsValid) 
    {
      // Copy the validation results into ModelState.
      // ASP.NET uses the ModelState collection to populate 
      // error messages in the View.
      result.AddToModelState(this.ModelState);

      // re-render the view when validation failed.
      return View("Create", person);
    }

    _repository.Save(person); //Save the person to the database, or some other logic

    TempData["notice"] = "Person successfully created";
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
  }
}
```

Because our validator is registered with the Service Provider, it will be injected into our controller via the constructor. We can then make use of the validator inside the `Create` action by invoking it with `ValidateAsync`. 

If validation fails, we need to pass the error messages back down to the view so they can be displayed to the end user. We can do this by defining an extension method for FluentValidation's `ValidationResult` type that copies the error messages into ASP.NET's `ModelState` dictionary:

```csharp
public static class Extensions 
{
  public static void AddToModelState(this ValidationResult result, ModelStateDictionary modelState) 
  {
    foreach (var error in result.Errors) 
    {
      modelState.AddModelError(error.PropertyName, error.ErrorMessage);
    }
  }
}
```

This method is invoked inside the controller action in the example above. 


For completeness, here is the corresponding View. This view will pick up the error messages from `ModelState` and display them next to the corresponding property. (If you were writing an API controller, then you'd probably return either a `ValidationProblemDetails` or `BadRequest` instead of a view result)

```html
@model Person

<div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly"></div>

<form asp-action="Create">
  Id: <input asp-for="Id" /> <span asp-validation-for="Id"></span>
  <br />
  Name: <input asp-for="Name" /> <span asp-validation-for="Name"></span>
  <br />
  Email: <input asp-for="Email" /> <span asp-validation-for="Email"></span>
  <br />
  Age: <input asp-for="Age" /> <span asp-validation-for="Age"></span>

  <br /><br />
  <input type="submit" value="submit" />
</form>
```

## Automatic Validation

Automatic validation instantiates and invokes a validator before the controller action is executed, meaning the ModelState will already be populated with validation results by the time your controller action is invoked. There are 2 implementations for this approach:

- Using ASP.NET's validation pipeline (no longer recommended)
- Using an Action Filter (supported by a 3rd party package)

### Using the ASP.NET Validation Pipeline

The `FluentValidation.AspNetCore` package provides auto-validation for ASP.NET Core MVC projects by plugging into ASP.NET's validation pipeline. 

With automatic validation using the validation pipeline, FluentValidation plugs into ASP.NET's bult-in validation process that's part of ASP.NET Core MVC and allows models to be validated before a controller action is invoked (during model-binding). This approach to validation is more seamless but has several downsides:

- **The ASP.NET validation pipeline is not asynchronous**: If your validator contains asynchronous rules then your validator will not be able to run. You will receive an exception at runtime if you attempt to use an asynchronous validator with auto-validation.
- **It is MVC-only**: This approach for auto-validation only works with MVC Controllers and Razor Pages. It does not work with the more modern parts of ASP.NET such as Minimal APIs or Blazor.
- **It is harder to debug**: The 'magic' nature of auto-validation makes it hard to debug/troubleshoot if something goes wrong as so much is done behind the scenes. 

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  We no longer recommend using this approach for new projects but it is still available for legacy implementations.
```

Instructions for this appraoch can be found in the `FluentValidation.AspNetCore` package [can be found on its project page here](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation.AspNetCore#aspnet-core-integration-for-fluentvalidation).

### Using a Filter

An alternative approach for performing automatic validation is to use an Action Filter. This approach works asynchronously which mitigates the synchronous limitation of the Validation Pipeline approach (above). Support for this approach isn't provided out of the box, but you can use the 3rd party [SharpGrip.FluentValidation.AutoValidation](https://github.com/SharpGrip/FluentValidation.AutoValidation) package for this purpose. 

## Clientside Validation

FluentValidation is a server-side library and does not provide any client-side validation directly. However, it can provide metadata which can be applied to the generated HTML elements for use with a client-side framework such as jQuery Validate in the same way that ASP.NET's default validation attributes work.

To make use of this metadata you'll need to install the separate `FluentValidation.AspNetCore` package. Instructions for installing and using this package [can be found on its project page here](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation.AspNetCore#aspnet-core-integration-for-fluentvalidation). Note that this package is no longer supported, but is still available to use. 

Alternatively, instead of using client-side validation you could instead execute your full server-side rules via AJAX using a library such as [FormHelper](https://github.com/sinanbozkus/FormHelper). This allows you to use the full power of FluentValidation, while still having a responsive user experience.

## Minimal APIs

When using FluentValidation with minimal APIs, you can still register the validators with the service provider, (or you can instantiate them directly if they don't have dependencies) and invoke them inside your API endpoint.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Register validator with service provider (or use one of the automatic registration methods)
builder.Services.AddScoped<IValidator<Person>, PersonValidator>();

// Also registering a DB access repository for demo purposes
// replace this with whatever you're using in your application.
builder.Services.AddScoped<IPersonRepository, PersonRepository>();

app.MapPost("/person", async (IValidator<Person> validator, IPersonRepository repository, Person person) => 
{
  ValidationResult validationResult = await validator.ValidateAsync(person);

  if (!validationResult.IsValid) 
  {
    return Results.ValidationProblem(validationResult.ToDictionary());
  }

  repository.Save(person);
  return Results.Created($"/{person.Id}", person);
});
```

Note the `ToDictionary` method on the `ValidationResult` is only available from FluentValidation 11.1 and newer. In older versions you will need to implement this as an extension method:

```csharp
public static class FluentValidationExtensions
{
  public static IDictionary<string, string[]> ToDictionary(this ValidationResult validationResult)
    {
      return validationResult.Errors
        .GroupBy(x => x.PropertyName)
        .ToDictionary(
          g => g.Key,
          g => g.Select(x => x.ErrorMessage).ToArray()
        );
    }
}

```

Alternatively, instead of manually invoking the validator you could use a filter to apply validation to an endpoint (or group of endpoints). This isn't supported out of the box, but you can use one of the following the third-party package for this purpose:

- [ForEvolve.FluentValidation.AspNetCore.Http](https://github.com/Carl-Hugo/FluentValidation.AspNetCore.Http)
- [SharpGrip.FluentValidation.AutoValidation](https://github.com/SharpGrip/FluentValidation.AutoValidation)


## async.md

# Asynchronous Validation

In some situations, you may wish to define asynchronous rules, for example when working with an external API. By default, FluentValidation allows custom rules defined with `MustAsync` or `CustomAsync` to be run asynchronously, as well as defining asynchronous conditions with `WhenAsync`.

A simplistic solution that checks if a user ID is already in use using an external web API:

```csharp
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> 
{
  SomeExternalWebApiClient _client;

  public CustomerValidator(SomeExternalWebApiClient client) 
  {
    _client = client;

    RuleFor(x => x.Id).MustAsync(async (id, cancellation) => 
    {
      bool exists = await _client.IdExists(id);
      return !exists;
    }).WithMessage("ID Must be unique");
  }
}
```

Invoking the validator is essentially the same, but you should now invoke it by calling `ValidateAsync`:

```csharp
var validator = new CustomerValidator(new SomeExternalWebApiClient());
var result = await validator.ValidateAsync(customer);
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
  Calling `ValidateAsync` will run both synchronous and asynchronous rules. 
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  If your validator contains asynchronous validators or asynchronous conditions, it's important that you *always* call `ValidateAsync` on your validator and never `Validate`. If you call `Validate`, then an exception will be thrown.

  You should not use asynchronous rules when `using automatic validation with ASP.NET <aspnet.html>`_ as ASP.NET's validation pipeline is not asynchronous. If you use asynchronous rules with ASP.NET's automatic validation, they will always be run synchronously (10.x and older) or throw an exception (11.x and newer).
```

# Blazor

FluentValidation does not provide integration with Blazor out of the box, but there are several third party libraries you can use to do this:

- [Blazored.FluentValidation](https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation)
- [Blazor-Validation](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-validation)
- [Accelist.FluentValidation.Blazor](https://github.com/ryanelian/FluentValidation.Blazor)

## built-in-validators.md

# Built-in Validators

FluentValidation ships with several built-in validators. The error message for each validator can contain special placeholders that will be filled in when the error message is constructed.

## NotNull Validator
Ensures that the specified property is not null.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull();
```
Example error: *'Surname' must not be empty.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## NotEmpty Validator
Ensures that the specified property is not null, an empty string or whitespace (or the default value for value types, e.g., 0 for `int`).
When used on an IEnumerable (such as arrays, collections, lists, etc.), the validator ensures that the IEnumerable is not empty.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotEmpty();
```
Example error: *'Surname' should not be empty.*
String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## NotEqual Validator

Ensures that the value of the specified property is not equal to a particular value (or not equal to the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Not equal to a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotEqual("Foo");

//Not equal to another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotEqual(customer => customer.Forename);
```
Example error: *'Surname' should not be equal to 'Foo'*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value that the property should not equal
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

Optionally, a comparer can be provided to ensure a specific type of comparison is performed:

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotEqual("Foo", StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

An ordinal comparison will be used by default. If you wish to do a culture-specific comparison instead, you should pass `StringComparer.CurrentCulture` as the second parameter.

## Equal Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is equal to a particular value (or equal to the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Equal to a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Equal("Foo");

//Equal to another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.Password).Equal(customer => customer.PasswordConfirmation);
```
Example error: *'Surname' should be equal to 'Foo'*
String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value that the property should equal
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Equal("Foo", StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

An ordinal comparison will be used by default. If you wish to do a culture-specific comparison instead, you should pass `StringComparer.CurrentCulture` as the second parameter.

## Length Validator
Ensures that the length of a particular string property is within the specified range. However, it doesn't ensure that the string property isn't null.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Length(1, 250); //must be between 1 and 250 chars (inclusive)
```
Example error: *'Surname' must be between 1 and 250 characters. You entered 251 characters.*

Note: Only valid on string properties.

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{MinLength}` – Minimum length
* `{MaxLength}` – Maximum length
* `{TotalLength}` – Number of characters entered
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## MaxLength Validator
Ensures that the length of a particular string property is no longer than the specified value.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).MaximumLength(250); //must be 250 chars or fewer
```
Example error: *The length of 'Surname' must be 250 characters or fewer. You entered 251 characters.*

Note: Only valid on string properties.

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{MaxLength}` – Maximum length
* `{TotalLength}` – Number of characters entered
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## MinLength Validator
Ensures that the length of a particular string property is longer than the specified value.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).MinimumLength(10); //must be 10 chars or more
```
Example error: *The length of 'Surname' must be at least 10 characters. You entered 5 characters.*

Note: Only valid on string properties.

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{MinLength}` – Minimum length
* `{TotalLength}` – Number of characters entered
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Less Than Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is less than a particular value (or less than the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Less than a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).LessThan(100);

//Less than another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).LessThan(customer => customer.MaxCreditLimit);
```
Example error: *'Credit Limit' must be less than 100.*

Notes: Only valid on types that implement `IComparable<T>`

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value to which the property was compared
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Less Than Or Equal Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is less than or equal to a particular value (or less than or equal to the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Less than a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).LessThanOrEqualTo(100);

//Less than another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).LessThanOrEqualTo(customer => customer.MaxCreditLimit);
```
Example error: *'Credit Limit' must be less than or equal to 100.*
Notes: Only valid on types that implement `IComparable<T>`
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value to which the property was compared
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Greater Than Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is greater than a particular value (or greater than the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Greater than a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).GreaterThan(0);

//Greater than another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).GreaterThan(customer => customer.MinimumCreditLimit);
```
Example error: *'Credit Limit' must be greater than 0.*
Notes: Only valid on types that implement `IComparable<T>`
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value to which the property was compared
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Greater Than Or Equal Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is greater than or equal to a particular value (or greater than or equal to the value of another property).

Example:
```csharp
//Greater than a particular value
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).GreaterThanOrEqualTo(1);

//Greater than another property
RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditLimit).GreaterThanOrEqualTo(customer => customer.MinimumCreditLimit);
```
Example error: *'Credit Limit' must be greater than or equal to 1.*
Notes: Only valid on types that implement `IComparable<T>`
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value to which the property was compared
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Predicate Validator
(Also known as `Must`)

Passes the value of the specified property into a delegate that can perform custom validation logic on the value.

Example:
```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Must(surname => surname == "Foo");
```

Example error: *The specified condition was not met for 'Surname'*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

Note that there is an additional overload for `Must` that also accepts an instance of the parent object being validated. This can be useful if you want to compare the current property with another property from inside the predicate:

```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Must((customer, surname) => surname != customer.Forename)
```

Note that in this particular example, it would be better to use the cross-property version of `NotEqual`.

## Regular Expression Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property matches the given regular expression.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).Matches("some regex here");
```
Example error: *'Surname' is not in the correct format.*
String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{RegularExpression}` – Regular expression that was not matched
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Email Validator
Ensures that the value of the specified property is a valid email address format.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Email).EmailAddress();
```
Example error: *'Email' is not a valid email address.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

The email address validator can work in 2 modes. The default mode just performs a simple check that the string contains an "@" sign which is not at the beginning or the end of the string. This is an intentionally naive check to match the behaviour of ASP.NET Core's `EmailAddressAttribute`, which performs the same check. For the reasoning behind this, see [this post](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/32740):

From the comments:

> "The check is intentionally naive because doing something infallible is very hard. The email really should be validated in some other way, such as through an email confirmation flow where an email is actually sent. The validation attribute is designed only to catch egregiously wrong values such as for a U.I."

Alternatively, you can use the old email validation behaviour that uses a regular expression consistent with the .NET 4.x version of the ASP.NET `EmailAddressAttribute`. You can use this behaviour in FluentValidation by calling `RuleFor(x => x.Email).EmailAddress(EmailValidationMode.Net4xRegex)`. Note that this approach is deprecated and will generate a warning as regex-based email validation is not recommended.

```eval_rst
.. note::
  In FluentValidation 9, the ASP.NET Core-compatible "simple" check is the default mode. In FluentValidation 8.x (and older), the Regex mode is the default.
```

## Credit Card Validator
Checks whether a string property could be a valid credit card number.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.CreditCard).CreditCard();
```
Example error: *'Credit Card' is not a valid credit card number.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Enum Validator
Checks whether a numeric value is valid to be in that enum. This is used to prevent numeric values from being cast to an enum type when the resulting value would be invalid. For example, the following is possible:

```csharp
public enum ErrorLevel 
{
  Error = 1,
  Warning = 2,
  Notice = 3
}

public class Model
{
  public ErrorLevel ErrorLevel { get; set; }
}

var model = new Model();
model.ErrorLevel = (ErrorLevel)4;
```

The compiler will allow this, but a value of 4 is technically not valid for this enum. The Enum validator can prevent this from happening.

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.ErrorLevel).IsInEnum();
```
Example error: *'Error Level' has a range of values which does not include '4'.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Enum Name Validator
Checks whether a string is a valid enum name.

Example:
```csharp
// For a case sensitive comparison
RuleFor(x => x.ErrorLevelName).IsEnumName(typeof(ErrorLevel));

// For a case-insensitive comparison
RuleFor(x => x.ErrorLevelName).IsEnumName(typeof(ErrorLevel), caseSensitive: false);
```
Example error: *'Error Level' has a range of values which does not include 'Foo'.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Empty Validator
Opposite of the `NotEmpty` validator. Checks if a property value is null, or is the default value for the type.
When used on an IEnumerable (such as arrays, collections, lists, etc.), the validator ensures that the IEnumerable is empty.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).Empty();
```
Example error: *'Surname' must be empty.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## Null Validator
Opposite of the `NotNull` validator. Checks if a property value is null.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).Null();
```
Example error: *'Surname' must be empty.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## ExclusiveBetween Validator
Checks whether the property value is in a range between the two specified numbers (exclusive).

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Id).ExclusiveBetween(1,10);
```
Example error: *'Id' must be between 1 and 10 (exclusive). You entered 1.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{From}` – Lower bound of the range
* `{To}` – Upper bound of the range
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## InclusiveBetween Validator
Checks whether the property value is in a range between the two specified numbers (inclusive).

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Id).InclusiveBetween(1,10);
```
Example error: *'Id' must be between 1 and 10. You entered 0.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{From}` – Lower bound of the range
* `{To}` – Upper bound of the range
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

## PrecisionScale Validator
Checks whether a decimal value has the specified precision and scale.

Example:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Amount).PrecisionScale(4, 2, false);
```
Example error: *'Amount' must not be more than 4 digits in total, with allowance for 2 decimals. 5 digits and 3 decimals were found.*

String format args:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Current value of the property
* `{ExpectedPrecision}` – Expected precision
* `{ExpectedScale}` – Expected scale
* `{Digits}` – Total number of digits in the property value
* `{ActualScale}` – Actual scale of the property value
* `{PropertyPath}` - The full path of the property

Note that the 3rd parameter of this method is `ignoreTrailingZeros`. When set to `true`, trailing zeros after the decimal point will not count towards the expected number of decimal places. 

Example:
- When `ignoreTrailingZeros` is `false` then the decimal `123.4500` will be considered to have a precision of 7 and scale of 4
- When `ignoreTrailingZeros` is `true` then the decimal `123.4500` will be considered to have a precision of 5 and scale of 2. 

Please also note that this method implies certain range of values that will be accepted. For example in case of `.PrecisionScale(3, 1)`, the method will accept values between `-99.9` and `99.9`, inclusive. Which means that integer part is always controlled to contain at most `3 - 1` digits, independently from `ignoreTrailingZeros` parameter.

Note that prior to FluentValidation 11.4, this method was called `ScalePrecision` instead and had its parameters reversed. For more details [see this GitHub issue](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2030)


## cascade.md

# Setting the Cascade mode

You can set the cascade mode to customise how FluentValidation executes rules and validators when a particular rule in the validator class, or validator in the rule fails.

## Rule-Level Cascade Modes
Imagine you have two validators defined as part of a single rule definition, a `NotNull` validator and a `NotEqual` validator:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
  public PersonValidator() {
    RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
  }
}
```

This will first check whether the Surname property is not null and then will check if it's not equal to the string "foo". If the first validator (`NotNull`) fails, then by default, the call to `NotEqual` will still be invoked. This can be changed for this specific rule only by specifying a cascade mode of `Stop` (omitting the class and constructor definition from now on; assume that they are still present as above):

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
```

Now, if the `NotNull` validator fails then the `NotEqual` validator will not be executed. This is particularly useful if you have a complex chain where each validator depends on the previous validator to succeed.

The two cascade modes are:
- `Continue` (the default) - always invokes all rules in a validator class, or all validators in a rule, depending on where it is used (see below).
- `Stop` - stops executing a validator class as soon as a rule fails, or stops executing a rule as soon as a validator fails, depending on where it is used (see below).

If you have a validator class with multiple rules, and would like this `Stop` behaviour to be set for all of your rules, you could do e.g.:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Forename).Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
RuleFor(x => x.MiddleNames).Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
```
To avoid repeating `Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop)`, you can set a default value for the rule-level cascade mode by setting the `AbstractValidator.RuleLevelCascadeMode` property, resulting in
```csharp
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;

RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
RuleFor(x => x.MiddleNames).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
```
With default global settings, this code will stop executing any rule whose `NotNull` call fails, and not call `NotEqual`, but it will then continue to the next rule, and always execute all three, regardless of failures. See "Validator Class-Level Cascade Modes" for how to control this behavior. This particular behaviour is useful if you want to create a list of all validation failures, as opposed to only returning the first one.

See "Global Default Cascade Modes" for setting the default value of this property.

## Validator Class-Level Cascade Modes
As well as being set at the rule level, the cascade mode can also be set at validator class-level, using the property `AbstractValidator.ClassLevelCascadeMode`. This controls the cascade behaviour _in between_ rules within that validator, but does not affect the rule-level cascade behaviour described above.

For example, the code above will execute all three rules, even if any of them fail. To stop execution of the validator class completely if any rule fails, you can set `AbstractValidator.ClassLevelCascadeMode` to `Stop`. This will result in complete "fail fast" behavior, and return only return a maximum of one error.

See "Global Default Cascade Modes" for setting the default value of this property.

## Global Default Cascade Modes
To set the default cascade modes at rule-level and/or validator class-level globally, set `ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode` and/or `ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultClassLevelCascadeMode` during your application's startup routine. Both of these default to `Continue`.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  The RuleLevelCascadeMode, ClassLevelCascadeMode, and their global defaults are only available in FluentValidation 11 and newer.
```

## Introduction of RuleLevelCascadeMode and ClassLevelCascadeMode (and removal of CascadeMode)
The `AbstractValidator.RuleLevelCascadeMode`, `AbstractValidator.ClassLevelCascadeMode`, and their global defaults were introduced in FluentValidation 11

In older versions, there was only one property controlling cascade modes: `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode`. Changing this value would set the cascade mode at both validator class-level and rule-level. Therefore, for example, if you wanted to have the above-described functionality where you create a list of validation errors, by stopping on failure at rule-level to avoid crashes, but continuing at validator class-level, you would need to set `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` to `Continue`, and then repeat `Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop)` on every rule chain.

The new properties enable finer control of the cascade mode at the different levels, with less repetition.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  The `CascadeMode` property was deprecated in FluentValidation 11 and removed in FluentValidation 12. The `RuleLevelCascadeMode` and `ClassLevelCascadeMode` properties should be used instead.
  
  To convert to the new properties, see `the upgrade guide <upgrading-to-11.html#cascade-mode-changes>`_.
```


## collections.md

# Collections

## Collections of Simple Types

You can use the `RuleForEach` method to apply the same rule to multiple items in a collection:

```csharp
public class Person 
{
  public List<string> AddressLines { get; set; } = new List<string>();
}
```

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleForEach(x => x.AddressLines).NotNull();
  }
}
```

The above rule will run a NotNull check against each item in the `AddressLines` collection.

As of version 8.5, if you want to access the index of the collection element that caused the validation failure, you can use the special `{CollectionIndex}` placeholder:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleForEach(x => x.AddressLines).NotNull().WithMessage("Address {CollectionIndex} is required.");
  }
}
```

## Collections of Complex Types

You can also combine `RuleForEach` with `SetValidator` when the collection is of another complex objects. For example:

```csharp
public class Customer 
{
  public List<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
}

public class Order 
{
  public double Total { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
public class OrderValidator : AbstractValidator<Order> 
{
  public OrderValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Total).GreaterThan(0);
  }
}

public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> 
{
  public CustomerValidator() 
  {
    RuleForEach(x => x.Orders).SetValidator(new OrderValidator());
  }
}
```

Alternatively, as of FluentValidation 8.5, you can also define rules for child collection elements in-line using the `ChildRules` method:

```csharp
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> 
{
  public CustomerValidator() 
  {
    RuleForEach(x => x.Orders).ChildRules(order => 
    {
      order.RuleFor(x => x.Total).GreaterThan(0);
    });
  }
}
```

You can optionally include or exclude certain items in the collection from being validated by using the `Where` or `WhereAsync` methods. Note this must come directly after the call to `RuleForEach`:

```csharp
RuleForEach(x => x.Orders)
  .Where(x => x.Cost != null)
  .SetValidator(new OrderValidator());
```

As of version 8.2, an alternative to using `RuleForEach` is to call `ForEach` as part of a regular `RuleFor`. With this approach you can combine rules that act upon the entire collection with rules which act upon individual elements within the collection. For example, imagine you have the following 2 rules:

```csharp
// This rule acts on the whole collection (using RuleFor)
RuleFor(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(x => x.Count <= 10).WithMessage("No more than 10 orders are allowed");

// This rule acts on each individual element (using RuleForEach)
RuleForEach(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(order => order.Total > 0).WithMessage("Orders must have a total of more than 0")
```

The above 2 rules could be re-written as:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(x => x.Count <= 10).WithMessage("No more than 10 orders are allowed")
  .ForEach(orderRule => 
  {
    orderRule.Must(order => order.Total > 0).WithMessage("Orders must have a total of more than 0")
  });
```

We recommend using 2 separate rules as this is clearer and easier to read, but the option of combining them is available with the `ForEach` method.


## conditions.md

# Conditions

The `When` and `Unless` methods can be used to specify conditions that control when the rule should execute. For example, this rule on the `CustomerDiscount` property will only execute when `IsPreferredCustomer` is `true`:

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.CustomerDiscount).GreaterThan(0).When(customer => customer.IsPreferredCustomer);
```

The `Unless` method is simply the opposite of `When`.

If you need to specify the same condition for multiple rules then you can call the top-level `When` method instead of chaining the `When` call at the end of the rule:

```csharp
When(customer => customer.IsPreferred, () => {
   RuleFor(customer => customer.CustomerDiscount).GreaterThan(0);
   RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditCardNumber).NotNull();
});
```

This time, the condition will be applied to both rules. You can also chain a call to `Otherwise` which will invoke rules that don't match the condition:

```csharp
When(customer => customer.IsPreferred, () => {
   RuleFor(customer => customer.CustomerDiscount).GreaterThan(0);
   RuleFor(customer => customer.CreditCardNumber).NotNull();
}).Otherwise(() => {
  RuleFor(customer => customer.CustomerDiscount).Equal(0);
});
```

By default FluentValidation will apply the condition to all preceding validators in the same call to `RuleFor`. If you only want the condition to apply to the validator that immediately precedes the condition, you must explicitly specify this:

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.CustomerDiscount)
    .GreaterThan(0).When(customer => customer.IsPreferredCustomer, ApplyConditionTo.CurrentValidator)
    .EqualTo(0).When(customer => ! customer.IsPreferredCustomer, ApplyConditionTo.CurrentValidator);
```

If the second parameter is not specified, then it defaults to `ApplyConditionTo.AllValidators`, meaning that the condition will apply to all preceding validators in the same chain.

If you need this behaviour, be aware that you must specify `ApplyConditionTo.CurrentValidator` as part of *every* condition. In the following example the first call to `When` applies to only the call to `Matches`, but not the call to `NotEmpty`. The second call to `When` applies only to the call to `Empty`.

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Photo)
    .NotEmpty()
    .Matches("https://wwww.photos.io/\d+\.png")
    .When(customer => customer.IsPreferredCustomer, ApplyConditionTo.CurrentValidator)
    .Empty()
    .When(customer => ! customer.IsPreferredCustomer, ApplyConditionTo.CurrentValidator);
```


## configuring.md

# Overriding the Message

You can override the default error message for a validator by calling the WithMessage method on a validator definition:

```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage("Please ensure that you have entered your Surname");
```

Note that custom error messages can contain placeholders for special values such as `{PropertyName}` - which will be replaced in this example with the name of the property being validated. This means the above error message could be re-written as:

```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage("Please ensure you have entered your {PropertyName}");
```

...and the value `Surname` will be inserted.

## Placeholders

As shown in the example above, the message can contain placeholders for special values such as `{PropertyName}` - which will be replaced at runtime. Each built-in validator has its own list of placeholders.

The placeholders used in all validators are:
* `{PropertyName}` – Name of the property being validated
* `{PropertyValue}` – Value of the property being validated
These include the predicate validator (`Must` validator), the email and the regex validators.

Used in comparison validators: (`Equal`, `NotEqual`, `GreaterThan`, `GreaterThanOrEqual`, etc.)
* `{ComparisonValue}` – Value that the property should be compared to
* `{ComparisonProperty}` – Name of the property being compared against (if any)

Used only in the Length validator:
* `{MinLength}` – Minimum length
* `{MaxLength}` – Maximum length
* `{TotalLength}` – Number of characters entered

For a complete list of error message placeholders see the [Built in Validators page](built-in-validators). Each built in validator has its own supported placeholders.

It is also possible to use your own custom arguments in the validation message. These can either be static values or references to other properties on the object being validated. This can be done by using the overload of `WithMessage` that takes a lambda expression, and then passing the values to `string.Format` or by using string interpolation.

```csharp
//Using constant in a custom message:
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname)
  .NotNull()
  .WithMessage(customer => string.Format("This message references some constant values: {0} {1}", "hello", 5))
//Result would be "This message references some constant values: hello 5"

//Referencing other property values:
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname)
  .NotNull()
  .WithMessage(customer => $"This message references some other properties: Forename: {customer.Forename} Discount: {customer.Discount}");
//Result would be: "This message references some other properties: Forename: Jeremy Discount: 100"
```

If you want to override all of FluentValidation's default error messages, check out FluentValidation's support for [Localization](localization).

# Overriding the Property Name

The default validation error messages contain the property name being validated. For example, if you were to define a validator like this:
```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull();
```

...then the default error message would be *'Surname' must not be empty*. Although you can override the entire error message by calling `WithMessage`, you can also replace just the property name by calling `WithName`:

```
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull().WithName("Last name");
```

Now the error message would be *'Last name' must not be empty.*

Note that this only replaces the name of the property in the error message. When you inspect the `Errors` collection on the `ValidationResult`, this error will still be associated with a property called `Surname`.
If you want to completely rename the property, you can use the `OverridePropertyName` method instead.

There is also an overload of `WithName` that accepts a lambda expression in a similar way to `WithMessage` in the previous section:

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull().WithName(customer => "Last name for customer " + customer.Id);
```

Property name resolution is also pluggable. By default, the name of the property extracted from the `MemberExpression` passed to `RuleFor`. If you want to change this logic, you can set the `DisplayNameResolver` property on the `ValidatorOptions` class:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.DisplayNameResolver = (type, member, expression) => 
{
  if(member != null) 
  {
     return member.Name + "Foo";
  }
  return null;
};
```

This is not a realistic example as it changes all properties to have the suffix `Foo`, but hopefully illustrates the point.

# Overriding the indexer for collections

When validating a collection using `RuleForEach`, the property name associated with validation failures will contain the collection index within square brackets (for example `Foo.BarList[5].Baz`). To change this behaviour you can use the `.OverrideIndexer` method:

```csharp
RuleForEach(x => x.BarList)
  .OverrideIndexer((foo, barList, bar, i) => bar.Name)
```

The above example would remove the square brackets and just use the property name. 


## custom-state.md

# Custom State

There may be an occasion where you'd like to return contextual information about the state of your validation rule when it was run. The `WithState` method allows you to associate any custom data with the validation results.

We could assign a custom state by modifying a line to read:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(person => person.Surname).NotNull();
    RuleFor(person => person.Forename).NotNull().WithState(person => 1234);  
  }
}
```

This state is then available within the `CustomState` property of the `ValidationFailure`.

```csharp
var validator = new PersonValidator();
var result = validator.Validate(new Person());
foreach (var failure in result.Errors) 
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Property: {failure.PropertyName} State: {failure.CustomState}");
}
```

The output would be:

```
Property: Surname State:
Property: Forename State: 1234
```

By default the `CustomState` property will be `null` if `WithState` hasn't been called.


## custom-validators.md

# Custom Validators

There are several ways to create a custom, reusable validator. The recommended way is to make use of the [Predicate Validator](built-in-validators.html#predicate-validator) to write a custom validation function, but you can also use the `Custom` method to take full control of the validation process.

For these examples, we'll imagine a scenario where you want to create a reusable validator that will ensure a List object contains fewer than 10 items.

## Predicate Validator
The simplest way to implement a custom validator is by using the `Must` method, which internally uses the `PredicateValidator`.

Imagine we have the following class:
```csharp
public class Person {
  public IList<Pet> Pets {get;set;} = new List<Pet>();
}
```

To ensure our list property contains fewer than 10 items, we could do this:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
  public PersonValidator() {
    RuleFor(x => x.Pets).Must(list => list.Count < 10)
      .WithMessage("The list must contain fewer than 10 items");
  }
}
```

To make this logic reusable, we can wrap it an extension method that acts upon any `List<T>` type.

```csharp
public static class MyCustomValidators {
  public static IRuleBuilderOptions<T, IList<TElement>> ListMustContainFewerThan<T, TElement>(this IRuleBuilder<T, IList<TElement>> ruleBuilder, int num) {
	return ruleBuilder.Must(list => list.Count < num).WithMessage("The list contains too many items");
  }
}
```

Here we create an extension method on `IRuleBuilder<T,TProperty>`, and we use a generic type constraint to ensure this method only appears in intellisense for List types. Inside the method, we call the Must method in the same way as before but this time we call it on the passed-in `RuleBuilder` instance. We also pass in the number of items for comparison as a parameter. Our rule definition can now be rewritten to use this method:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Pets).ListMustContainFewerThan(10);
```

## Custom message placeholders

We can extend the above example to include a more useful error message. At the moment, our custom validator always returns the message "The list contains too many items" if validation fails. Instead, let's change the message so it returns "'Pets' must contain fewer than 10 items." This can be done by using custom message placeholders. FluentValidation supports several message placeholders by default including `{PropertyName}` and `{PropertyValue}` ([see this list for more](built-in-validators)), but we can also add our own.

We need to modify our extension method slightly to use a different overload of the `Must` method, one that accepts a `ValidationContext<T>` instance. This context provides additional information and methods we can use when performing validation:

```csharp
public static IRuleBuilderOptions<T, IList<TElement>> ListMustContainFewerThan<T, TElement>(this IRuleBuilder<T, IList<TElement>> ruleBuilder, int num) {

  return ruleBuilder.Must((rootObject, list, context) => {
    context.MessageFormatter.AppendArgument("MaxElements", num);
    return list.Count < num;
  })
  .WithMessage("{PropertyName} must contain fewer than {MaxElements} items.");
}
```

Note that the overload of Must that we're using now accepts 3 parameters: the root (parent) object, the property value itself, and the context. We use the context to add a custom message replacement value of `MaxElements` and set its value to the number passed to the method. We can now use this placeholder as `{MaxElements}` within the call to `WithMessage`.

The resulting message will now be `'Pets' must contain fewer than 10 items.` We could even extend this further to include the number of elements that the list contains like this:

```csharp
public static IRuleBuilderOptions<T, IList<TElement>> ListMustContainFewerThan<T, TElement>(this IRuleBuilder<T, IList<TElement>> ruleBuilder, int num) {

  return ruleBuilder.Must((rootObject, list, context) => {
    context.MessageFormatter
      .AppendArgument("MaxElements", num)
      .AppendArgument("TotalElements", list.Count);

    return list.Count < num;
  })
  .WithMessage("{PropertyName} must contain fewer than {MaxElements} items. The list contains {TotalElements} element");
}
```

## Writing a Custom Validator

If you need more control of the validation process than is available with `Must`, you can write a custom rule using the `Custom` method. This method allows you to manually create the `ValidationFailure` instance associated with the validation error. Usually, the framework does this for you, so it is more verbose than using `Must`.


```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
  public PersonValidator() {
   RuleFor(x => x.Pets).Custom((list, context) => {
     if(list.Count > 10) {
       context.AddFailure("The list must contain 10 items or fewer");
     }
   });
  }
}
```

The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to return multiple errors for the same rule (by calling the `context.AddFailure` method multiple times). In the above example, the property name in the generated error will be inferred as "Pets", although this could be overridden by calling a different overload of `AddFailure`:

```csharp
context.AddFailure("SomeOtherProperty", "The list must contain 10 items or fewer");
// Or you can instantiate the ValidationFailure directly:
context.AddFailure(new ValidationFailure("SomeOtherProperty", "The list must contain 10 items or fewer");
```

As before, this could be wrapped in an extension method to simplify the consuming code.

```csharp
public static IRuleBuilderOptionsConditions<T, IList<TElement>> ListMustContainFewerThan<T, TElement>(this IRuleBuilder<T, IList<TElement>> ruleBuilder, int num) {

  return ruleBuilder.Custom((list, context) => {
     if(list.Count > 10) {
       context.AddFailure("The list must contain 10 items or fewer");
     }
   });
}
```

## Reusable Property Validators

In some cases where your custom logic is very complex, you may wish to move the custom logic into a separate class. This can be done by writing a class that inherits from the abstract `PropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` class (this is how all of FluentValidation's built-in rules are defined).

```eval_rst
.. note::
  This is an advanced technique that is usually unnecessary - the `Must` and `Custom` methods explained above are usually more appropriate.
```

We can recreate the above example using a custom `PropertyValidator` implementation like this:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using FluentValidation.Validators;

public class ListCountValidator<T, TCollectionElement> : PropertyValidator<T, IList<TCollectionElement>> {
	private int _max;

	public ListCountValidator(int max) {
		_max = max;
	}

	public override bool IsValid(ValidationContext<T> context, IList<TCollectionElement> list) {
		if(list != null && list.Count >= _max) {
			context.MessageFormatter.AppendArgument("MaxElements", _max);
			return false;
		}

		return true;
	}

  public override string Name => "ListCountValidator";

	protected override string GetDefaultMessageTemplate(string errorCode)
		=> "{PropertyName} must contain fewer than {MaxElements} items.";
}
```
When you inherit from `PropertyValidator` you must override the `IsValid` method. This method receives two values - the `ValidationContext<T>` representing the current validation run, and the value of the property. The method should return a boolean indicating whether validation was successful. The generic type parameters on the base class represent the root instance being validated, and the type of the property that our custom validator can act upon. In this case we're constraining the custom validator to types that implement `IList<TCollectionElement>` although this can be left open if desired.

Note that the error message to use is specified by overriding `GetDefaultMessageTemplate`.

To use the new custom validator you can call `SetValidator` when defining a validation rule.

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
    public PersonValidator() {
       RuleFor(person => person.Pets).SetValidator(new ListCountValidator<Person, Pet>(10));
    }
}
```

As with the first example, you can wrap this in an extension method to make the syntax nicer:
```csharp
public static class MyValidatorExtensions {
   public static IRuleBuilderOptions<T, IList<TElement>> ListMustContainFewerThan<T, TElement>(this IRuleBuilder<T, IList<TElement>> ruleBuilder, int num) {
      return ruleBuilder.SetValidator(new ListCountValidator<T, TElement>(num));
   }
}
```

...which can then be chained like any other validator:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
    public PersonValidator() {
       RuleFor(person => person.Pets).ListMustContainFewerThan(10);
    }
}
```

As another simpler example, this is how FluentValidation's own `NotNull` validator is implemented:

```csharp
public class NotNullValidator<T,TProperty> : PropertyValidator<T,TProperty> {

  public override string Name => "NotNullValidator";

  public override bool IsValid(ValidationContext<T> context, TProperty value) {
    return value != null;
  }

  protected override string GetDefaultMessageTemplate(string errorCode)
    => "'{PropertyName}' must not be empty.";
}

```


## dependentrules.md

# Dependent Rules


By default, all rules in FluentValidation are separate and cannot influence one another. This is intentional and necessary for asynchronous validation to work. However, there may be some cases where you want to ensure that some rules are only executed after another has completed. You can use `DependentRules` to do this.

To use dependent rules, call the `DependentRules` method at the end of the rule that you want others to depend on. This method accepts a lambda expression inside which you can define other rules that will be executed only if the first rule passes:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().DependentRules(() => {
  RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotNull();
});
```

Here the rule against Forename will only be run if the Surname rule passes.

_Author's note_: Personally I do not particularly like using dependent rules as I feel it's fairly hard to read, especially with a complex set of rules. In many cases, it can be simpler to use `When` conditions combined with `CascadeMode` to prevent rules from running in certain situations. Even though this can sometimes mean more duplication, it is often easier to read.


## di.md

# Dependency Injection

Validators can be used with any dependency injection library, such as `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`. To inject a validator for a specific model, you should register the validator with the service provider as `IValidator<T>`, where `T` is the type of object being validated.

For example, imagine you have the following validator defined in your project:

```csharp
public class UserValidator : AbstractValidator<User>
{
  public UserValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotNull();
  }
}
```

This validator can be registered as `IValidator<User>` in your application's startup routine by calling into the .NET service provider. For example, in a Razor pages application the startup routine would look something like this:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddRazorPages();
        services.AddScoped<IValidator<User>, UserValidator>();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
      // ...
    }
}
```

You can then inject the validator as you would with any other dependency:

```c#
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IValidator<User> _validator;

    public UserService(IValidator<User> validator)
    {
        _validator = validator;
    }

    public async Task DoSomething(User user)
    {
        var validationResult = await _validator.ValidateAsync(user);
    }
}
```

## Automatic registration

You can also make use of the `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions` package which can be used to automatically find all the validators in a specific assembly using an extension method:

```csharp
using FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<UserValidator>();
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

This will loop through all public types in the same assembly in which `UserValidator` is defined, find all public non-abstract validators and register them with the service provider. By default, these will be registered as `Scoped`, but you can optionally use `Singleton` or `Transient` instead:

```csharp
services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<UserValidator>(ServiceLifetime.Transient);
```

If you aren't familiar with the difference between Singleton, Scoped and Transient [please review the Microsoft dependency injection documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes)


```eval_rst
.. warning::
   If you register a validator as Singleton, you should ensure that you don't inject anything that's transient or request-scoped into the validator. We typically don't recommend registering validators as Singleton unless you are experienced with using Dependency Injection and know how to troubleshoot issues related to singleton-scoped objects having on non-singleton dependencies. Registering validators as Transient is the simplest and safest option.
```

When using FluentValidation in an ASP.NET project with auto-validation, the same scanning logic can be performed as part of the call to `AddFluentValidation`. [See the documentation on ASP.NET integration for details](aspnet).

Alternative method overloads that take a type instance and an assembly reference exist too:

```csharp
// Load using a type reference rather than the generic.
services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining(typeof(UserValidator));

// Load an assembly reference rather than using a marker type.
services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(Assembly.Load("SomeAssembly"));
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
   The auto-registration methods used above use reflection to scan one or more assemblies for validators. An alternative approach would be to use a source generator such as `AutoRegisterInject <https://github.com/patrickklaeren/AutoRegisterInject>`_ to set up registrations automatically. 
```

### Filtering results

You can provide an optional filter function that can be used to exclude some validators from automatic registration. For example, to register all validators *except* the `CustomerValidator` you could write the following:

```csharp
services.AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<MyValidator>(ServiceLifetime.Scoped, 
    filter => filter.ValidatorType != typeof(CustomerValidator));
```

The `CustomerValidator` will not be added to the service provider (but all other validators will).


## error-codes.md

# Custom Error Codes

A custom error code can also be associated with validation rules by calling the `WithErrorCode` method:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(person => person.Surname).NotNull().WithErrorCode("ERR1234");        
    RuleFor(person => person.Forename).NotNull();
  }
}
```

The resulting error code can be obtained from the `ErrorCode` property on the `ValidationFailure`:

```csharp
var validator = new PersonValidator();
var result = validator.Validate(new Person());
foreach (var failure in result.Errors)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Property: {failure.PropertyName} Error Code: {failure.ErrorCode}");
}
```

The output would be:

```
Property: Surname Error Code: ERR1234
Property: Forename Error Code: NotNullValidator
```

## ErrorCode and Error Messages

The `ErrorCode` is also used to determine the default error message for a particular validator. At a high level:

* The error code is used as the lookup key for an error message. For example, a `NotNull()` validator has a default error code of `NotNullValidator`, which used to look up the error messages from the `LanguageManager`. [See the documentation on localization.](localization)
* If you provide an error code, you could also provide a localized message with the name of that error code to create a custom message.
* If you provide an error code but no custom message, the message will fall back to the default message for that validator. You're not required to add a custom message.
* Using `ErrorCode` can also be used to override the default error message. For example, if you use a custom `Must()` validator, but you'd like to reuse the `NotNull()` validator's default error message, you can call `WithErrorCode("NotNullValidator")` to achieve this result.


## including-rules.md

# Including Rules

You can include rules from other validators provided they validate the same type. This allows you to split rules across multiple classes and compose them together (in a similar way to how other languages support traits). For example, imagine you have 2 validators that validate different aspects of a `Person`:

```csharp
public class PersonAgeValidator : AbstractValidator<Person>  
{
  public PersonAgeValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.DateOfBirth).Must(BeOver18);
  }

  protected bool BeOver18(DateTime date) 
  {
    //...
  }
}

public class PersonNameValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonNameValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().Length(0, 255);
    RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotNull().Length(0, 255);
  }
}
```

Because both of these validators are targetting the same model type (`Person`), you can combine them using `Include`:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator()
   {
    Include(new PersonAgeValidator());
    Include(new PersonNameValidator());
  }
}
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
    You can only include validators that target the same type as the root validator.
```


## inheritance.md

# Inheritance Validation

As of FluentValidation 9.2, if your object contains a property which is a base class or interface, you can set up specific [child validators](start.html#complex-properties) for individual subclasses/implementors.

For example, imagine the following example:

```csharp
// We have an interface that represents a 'contact',
// for example in a CRM system. All contacts must have a name and email.
public interface IContact 
{
  string Name { get; set; }
  string Email { get; set; }
}

// A Person is a type of contact, with a name and a DOB.
public class Person : IContact 
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Email { get; set; }

  public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}

// An organisation is another type of contact,
// with a name and the address of their HQ.
public class Organisation : IContact 
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Email { get; set; }

  public Address Headquarters { get; set; }
}

// Our model class that we'll be validating.
// This might be a request to send a message to a contact.
public class ContactRequest 
{
  public IContact Contact { get; set; }

  public string MessageToSend { get; set; }
}
```

Next we create validators for Person and Organisation:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.Email).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.DateOfBirth).GreaterThan(DateTime.MinValue);
  }
}

public class OrganisationValidator : AbstractValidator<Organisation> 
{
  public OrganisationValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.Email).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.HeadQuarters).SetValidator(new AddressValidator());
  }
}
```

Now we create a validator for our `ContactRequest`. We can define specific validators for the `Contact` property, depending on its runtime type. This is done by calling `SetInheritanceValidator`, passing in a function that can be used to define specific child validators:

```csharp
public class ContactRequestValidator : AbstractValidator<ContactRequest>
{
  public ContactRequestValidator()
  {

    RuleFor(x => x.Contact).SetInheritanceValidator(v => 
    {
      v.Add<Organisation>(new OrganisationValidator());
      v.Add<Person>(new PersonValidator());
    });

  }
}
```

There are also overloads of `Add` available that take a callback, which allows for lazy construction of the child validators.

This method also works with [collections](collections), where each element of the collection may be a different subclass. For example, taking the above example if instead of a single `Contact` property, the `ContactRequest` instead had a collection of contacts:

```csharp
public class ContactRequest 
{
  public List<IContact> Contacts { get; } = new();
}
```

...then you could define inheritance validation for each item in the collection:

```csharp
public class ContactRequestValidator : AbstractValidator<ContactRequest>
{
  public ContactRequestValidator()
  {

    RuleForEach(x => x.Contacts).SetInheritanceValidator(v => 
    {
      v.Add<Organisation>(new OrganisationValidator());
      v.Add<Person>(new PersonValidator());
    });
  }
}
```

## Limitations

It's important to note that every subclass that you want to be validated *must be explicitly mapped*. For example, the following would not work:

```csharp
public class ContactBaseValidator : AbstractValidator<IContact> 
{
  public ContactBaseValidatoR() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Name).NotNull();
  }
}

public class ContactRequestValidator : AbstractValidator<ContactRequest>
{
  public ContactRequestValidator()
  {

    RuleFor(x => x.Contact).SetInheritanceValidator(v => 
    {
      // THIS WILL NOT WORK.
      // This will not validate instances of Person or Organisation.
      v.Add<IContact>(new ContactBaseValidator());
    });
  }
}
```

In the above example, this would not correctly validate instances of `Person` or `Organisation` as they have not been explicitly mapped. You must explicitly indicate every subclass that you want to have mapped, as per the first example at the top of the page. 


## installation.md

# Installation

```eval_rst
.. note::
    If you are upgrading to FluentValidation 12 from an older version, `please read the upgrade notes <upgrading-to-12.html>`_.
```

Before creating any validators, you will need to add a reference to FluentValidation.dll in your project. The simplest way to do this is to use either the NuGet package manager, or the dotnet CLI.

Using the NuGet package manager console within Visual Studio run the following command:

```
Install-Package FluentValidation
```

Or using the .net core CLI from a terminal window:

```
dotnet add package FluentValidation
```


## localization.md

# Localization

Out of the box, FluentValidation provides translations for the default validation messages in several languages. By default, the language specified in the .NET's framework's current UI culture will be used (`CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture`) when translating messages.

You can also use the `WithMessage` method to specify a localized error message for a single validation rule.

### WithMessage
If you are using Visual Studio's built in support for `.resx` files and their strongly-typed wrappers, then you can localize a message by calling the overload of `WithMessage` that accepts a lambda expression:

```
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage(x => MyLocalizedMessages.SurnameRequired);
```
You could also use the same approach if you need to obtain the localized message from another source (such as a database) by obtaining the string from within the lambda.

### IStringLocalizer

The above 2 examples assume you're using a strongly-typed wrapper around a resource file, where each static property on the class corresponds to a key within the resource file. This is the "old" way of working with resources prior to ASP.NET Core, but is not relevant if you're using ASP.NET Core's `IStringLocalizer`.

If you are using `IStringLocalizer` to handle localization then all you need to do is inject your localizer into your validator, and use it within a `WithMessage` callback, for example:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator(IStringLocalizer<Person> localizer)
   {
    RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage(x => localizer["Surname is required"]);
  }
}
```

### Default Messages
If you want to replace all (or some) of FluentValidation's default messages then you can do this by implementing a custom version of the `ILanguageManager` interface.

For example, the default message for the `NotNull` validator is `'{PropertyName}' must not be empty.`. If you wanted to replace this message for all uses of the `NotNull` validator in your application, you could write a custom Language Manager:

```csharp
public class CustomLanguageManager : FluentValidation.Resources.LanguageManager
{
  public CustomLanguageManager() 
  {
    AddTranslation("en", "NotNullValidator", "'{PropertyName}' is required.");
    AddTranslation("en-US", "NotNullValidator", "'{PropertyName}' is required.");
    AddTranslation("en-GB", "NotNullValidator", "'{PropertyName}' is required.");
  }
}
```

Here we have a custom class that inherits from the base `LanguageManager`. In its constructor we call the `AddTranslation` method passing in the language we're using, the name of the validator we want to override, and the new message.

Once this is done, we can replace the default LanguageManager by setting the LanguageManager property in the static `ValidatorOptions` class during your application's startup routine:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.LanguageManager = new CustomLanguageManager();
```

Note that if you replace messages in the `en` culture, you should consider also replacing the messages for `en-US` and `en-GB` too, as these will take precedence for users from these locales.

This is a simple example that only replaces one validator's message in English only, but could be extended to replace the messages for all languages. Instead of inheriting from the default LanguageManager, you could also implement the `ILanguageManager` interface directly if you want to load the messages from a completely different location other than the FluentValidation default (for example, if you wanted to store FluentValidation's default messages in a database).

Of course, if all you want to do is replace this message for a single use of a validator, then you could just use `WithMessage("'{PropertyName}' is required");`

### Contributing Languages
If you'd like to contribute a translation of FluentValidation's default messages, please open a pull request that adds a language file to the project. The current language files are [located in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/tree/master/src/FluentValidation/Resources/Languages). Additionally you'll need to [add the new language to the default LanguageManager](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/blob/main/src/FluentValidation/Resources/LanguageManager.cs#L38) 

[The default English messages are stored here](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/blob/master/src/FluentValidation/Resources/Languages/EnglishLanguage.cs)

### Disabling Localization
You can completely disable FluentValidation's support for localization, which will force the default English messages to be used, regardless of the thread's `CurrentUICulture`. This can be done in your application's startup routine by calling into the static `ValidatorOptions` class:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.LanguageManager.Enabled = false;
```
You can also force the default messages to always be displayed in a specific language:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.LanguageManager.Culture = new CultureInfo("fr");
```


## mvc5.md

# ASP.NET MVC 5

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   Integration with ASP.NET MVC 5 is no longer supported as of FluentValidation 9. Please migrate to ASP.NET Core.
```

FluentValidation 8.x provided integration with ASP.NET MVC 5. This is no longer maintained or supported, and is not compatible with FluentValidation 9 or newer.

For instructions on using these unsupported legacy components with FluentValidation 8, [please review this page](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation-LegacyWeb/wiki/MVC-5-Integration)


## rulesets.md

# RuleSets

RuleSets allow you to group validation rules together which can be executed together as a group whilst ignoring other rules:

For example, let's imagine we have 3 properties on a Person object (Id, Surname and Forename) and have a validation rule for each. We could group the Surname and Forename rules together in a “Names” RuleSet:

```csharp
 public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
 {
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
     RuleSet("Names", () => 
     {
        RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull();
        RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotNull();
     });

     RuleFor(x => x.Id).NotEqual(0);
  }
}
```

Here the two rules on Surname and Forename are grouped together in a “Names” RuleSet. We can invoke only these rules by passing additional options to the Validate method:

```csharp
var validator = new PersonValidator();
var person = new Person();
var result = validator.Validate(person, options => options.IncludeRuleSets("Names"));
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
  Many of the methods in FluentValidation are extension methods such as "Validate" above and require the FluentValidation namespace to be imported via a using statement, e.g. "using FluentValidation;".
```

This allows you to break down a complex validator definition into smaller segments that can be executed in isolation. If you call `Validate` without passing a ruleset then only rules not in a RuleSet will be executed.

You can execute multiple rulesets by passing multiple ruleset names to `IncludeRuleSets`:

```csharp
var result = validator.Validate(person, options => 
{
  options.IncludeRuleSets("Names", "MyRuleSet", "SomeOtherRuleSet");
});
```

You can also include all the rules not part of a ruleset by calling `IncludeRulesNotInRuleSet`, or by using the special name "default" (case insensitive):

```csharp
validator.Validate(person, options => 
{
  // Option 1: IncludeRulesNotInRuleSet is the equivalent of using the special ruleset name "default"
  options.IncludeRuleSets("Names").IncludeRulesNotInRuleSet();
  // Option 2: This does the same thing.
  option.IncludeRuleSets("Names", "default");
});
```

This would execute rules in the MyRuleSet set, and those rules not in any ruleset. Note that you shouldn't create your own ruleset called "default", as FluentValidation will treat these rules as not being in a ruleset.

You can force all rules to be executed regardless of whether or not they're in a ruleset by calling `IncludeAllRuleSets` (this is the equivalent of using `IncludeRuleSets("*")` )

```csharp
validator.Validate(person, options => 
{
  options.IncludeAllRuleSets();
});
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
 If you include a child validator using "SetValidator" it will, by default, inherit the ruleset configuration from the parent validator and cascade through to its own child rules. This means the rulesets will also need to be applied to rules within the child validator. This behaviour can be overridden by passing an explicit override ruleset to the SetValidator call. 
```


## severity.md

# Setting the Severity Level

Given the following example that validates a `Person` object:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person>
{
  public PersonValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(person => person.Surname).NotNull();
    RuleFor(person => person.Forename).NotNull();
  }
}
```

By default, if these rules fail they will have a severity of `Error`. This can be changed by calling the `WithSeverity` method. For example, if we wanted a missing surname to be identified as a warning instead of an error then we could modify the above line to:

```
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithSeverity(Severity.Warning);
```

In version 9.0 and above a callback can be used instead, which also gives you access to the item being validated:

```
RuleFor(person => person.Surname).NotNull().WithSeverity(person => Severity.Warning);
```

In this case, the `ValidationResult` would still have an `IsValid` result of `false`. However, in the list of `Errors`, the `ValidationFailure` associated with this field will have its `Severity` property set to `Warning`:

```csharp
var validator = new PersonValidator();
var result = validator.Validate(new Person());
foreach (var failure in result.Errors) 
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Property: {failure.PropertyName} Severity: {failure.Severity}");
}
```

The output would be:

```
Property: Surname Severity: Warning
Property: Forename Severity: Error
```

By default, the severity level of every validation rule is `Error`. Available options are `Error`, `Warning`, or `Info`.

To set the severity level globally, you can set the `Severity` property on the static `ValidatorOptions` class during your application's startup routine:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.Severity = Severity.Info;
```

This can then be overridden by individual rules.


## specific-properties.md

# Validating specific properties

If your validator contains rules for several properties you can limit execution to only validate specific properties by using the `IncludeProperties` option:

```csharp
// Validator definition
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer>
{
  public CustomerValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull();
    RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotNull();
    RuleForEach(x => x.Orders).SetValidator(new OrderValidator());
  }
}
```

```csharp
var validator = new CustomerValidator();
validator.Validate(customer, options => 
{
  options.IncludeProperties(x => x.Surname);
});
```

In the above example only the rule for the `Surname` property will be executed. 

When working with sub-properties of collections, you can use a wildcard indexer (`[]`) to indicate all items of a collection. For example, if you wanted to validate the `Cost` property of every order, you could use the following:

```csharp
var validator = new CustomerValidator();
validator.Validate(customer, options => 
{
  options.IncludeProperties("Orders[].Cost");
});
```

If you want more arbitrary grouping of rules you can use [Rule Sets](rulesets) instead. 


## start.md

# Creating your first validator

To define a set of validation rules for a particular object, you will need to create a class that inherits from `AbstractValidator<T>`, where `T` is the type of class that you wish to validate.

For example, imagine that you have a Customer class:

```csharp
public class Customer 
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Surname { get; set; }
  public string Forename { get; set; }
  public decimal Discount { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
}
```

You would define a set of validation rules for this class by inheriting from `AbstractValidator<Customer>`:

```csharp
using FluentValidation;

public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> 
{
}
```

The validation rules themselves should be defined in the validator class's constructor.

To specify a validation rule for a particular property, call the `RuleFor` method, passing a lambda expression
that indicates the property that you wish to validate. For example, to ensure that the `Surname` property is not null,
the validator class would look like this:

```csharp
using FluentValidation;

public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer>
{
  public CustomerValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull();
  }
}
```
To run the validator, instantiate the validator object and call the `Validate` method, passing in the object to validate.

```csharp
Customer customer = new Customer();
CustomerValidator validator = new CustomerValidator();

ValidationResult result = validator.Validate(customer);

```

The `Validate` method returns a ValidationResult object. This contains two properties:

- `IsValid` - a boolean that says whether the validation succeeded.
- `Errors` - a collection of ValidationFailure objects containing details about any validation failures.

The following code would write any validation failures to the console:

```csharp
using FluentValidation.Results; 

Customer customer = new Customer();
CustomerValidator validator = new CustomerValidator();

ValidationResult results = validator.Validate(customer);

if(! results.IsValid) 
{
  foreach(var failure in results.Errors)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Property " + failure.PropertyName + " failed validation. Error was: " + failure.ErrorMessage);
  }
}
```

You can also call `ToString` on the `ValidationResult` to combine all error messages into a single string. By default, the messages will be separated with new lines, but if you want to customize this behaviour you can pass a different separator character to `ToString`.

```csharp
ValidationResult results = validator.Validate(customer);
string allMessages = results.ToString("~");     // In this case, each message will be separated with a `~`
```

*Note* : if there are no validation errors, `ToString()` will return an empty string.

# Chaining validators

You can chain multiple validators together for the same property:

```csharp
using FluentValidation;

public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer>
{
  public CustomerValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(customer => customer.Surname).NotNull().NotEqual("foo");
  }
}
```

This would ensure that the surname is not null and is not equal to the string 'foo'.

# Throwing Exceptions

Instead of returning a `ValidationResult`, you can alternatively tell FluentValidation to throw an exception if validation fails by using the `ValidateAndThrow` method:

```csharp
Customer customer = new Customer();
CustomerValidator validator = new CustomerValidator();

validator.ValidateAndThrow(customer);
```

This throws a `ValidationException` which contains the error messages in the Errors property.

*Note* `ValidateAndThrow` is an extension method, so you must have the `FluentValidation` namespace imported with a `using` statement at the top of your file in order for this method to be available.

```csharp
using FluentValidation;
```

The `ValidateAndThrow` method is helpful wrapper around FluentValidation's options API, and is the equivalent of doing the following:

```csharp
validator.Validate(customer, options => options.ThrowOnFailures());
```

If you need to combine throwing an exception with [Rule Sets](rulesets), or validating individual properties, you can combine both options using this syntax:

```csharp
validator.Validate(customer, options => 
{
  options.ThrowOnFailures();
  options.IncludeRuleSets("MyRuleSets");
  options.IncludeProperties(x => x.Name);
});
```

It is also possible to customize type of exception thrown, [which is covered in this section](advanced.html#customizing-the-validation-exception).

# Complex Properties

Validators can be re-used for complex properties. For example, imagine you have two classes, Customer and Address:

```csharp
public class Customer 
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public Address Address { get; set; }
}

public class Address 
{
  public string Line1 { get; set; }
  public string Line2 { get; set; }
  public string Town { get; set; }
  public string Country { get; set; }
  public string Postcode { get; set; }
}
```

... and you define an AddressValidator:

```csharp
public class AddressValidator : AbstractValidator<Address> 
{
  public AddressValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(address => address.Postcode).NotNull();
    //etc
  }
}
```

... you can then re-use the AddressValidator in the CustomerValidator definition:

```csharp
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> 
{
  public CustomerValidator()
  {
    RuleFor(customer => customer.Name).NotNull();
    RuleFor(customer => customer.Address).SetValidator(new AddressValidator());
  }
}
```

... so when you call `Validate` on the CustomerValidator it will run through the validators defined in both the CustomerValidator and the AddressValidator and combine the results into a single ValidationResult.

If the child property is null, then the child validator will not be executed.

Instead of using a child validator, you can define child rules inline, eg:

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Address.Postcode).NotNull()
```

In this case, a null check will *not* be performed automatically on `Address`, so you should explicitly add a condition

```csharp
RuleFor(customer => customer.Address.Postcode).NotNull().When(customer => customer.Address != null)
```


## testing.md

# Test Extensions

FluentValidation provides some extensions that can aid with testing your validator classes.

We recommend treating validators as 'black boxes' - provide input to them and then assert whether the validation results are correct or incorrect.

## Using TestValidate

You can use the `TestValidate` extension method to invoke a validator for testing purposes, and then perform assertions against the result. This makes it easier to write tests for validators.

For example, imagine the following validator is defined:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person>
{
   public PersonValidator()
   {
      RuleFor(person => person.Name).NotNull();
   }
}
```

You could ensure that this validator works correctly by writing the following tests (using NUnit):

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using FluentValidation;
using FluentValidation.TestHelper;

[TestFixture]
public class PersonValidatorTester
{
    private PersonValidator validator;

    [SetUp]
    public void Setup()
    {
       validator = new PersonValidator();
    }

    [Test]
    public void Should_have_error_when_Name_is_null()
    {
      var model = new Person { Name = null };
      var result = validator.TestValidate(model);
      result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(person => person.Name);
    }

    [Test]
    public void Should_not_have_error_when_name_is_specified()
    {
      var model = new Person { Name = "Jeremy" };
      var result = validator.TestValidate(model);
      result.ShouldNotHaveValidationErrorFor(person => person.Name);
    }
}
```

If the assertion fails, then a `ValidationTestException` will be thrown.

If you have more complex tests, you can use the same technique to perform multiple assertions on a single validation result. For example:

```csharp
var person = new Person { Name = "Jeremy" };
var result = validator.TestValidate(person);

// Assert that there should be a failure for the Name property.
result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(x => x.Name);

// Assert that there are no failures for the age property.
result.ShouldNotHaveValidationErrorFor(x => x.Age);

// You can also use a string name for properties that can't be easily represented with a lambda, eg:
result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor("Addresses[0].Line1");
```

You can also chain additional method calls to the result of `ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor` that test individual components of the validation failure including the error message, severity, error code and custom state:

```csharp
var result = validator.TestValidate(person);

result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(person => person.Name)
  .WithErrorMessage("'Name' must not be empty.")
  .WithSeverity(Severity.Error)
  .WithErrorCode("NotNullValidator");
```

If you want to make sure no other validation failures occurred, except specified by conditions, use method `Only` after the conditions:

```csharp
var result = validator.TestValidate(person);

// Assert that failures only happened for Name property.
result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(person => person.Name).Only();

// Assert that failures only happened for Name property and all have the specified message
result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(person => person.Name)
  .WithErrorMessage("'Name' must not be empty.")
  .Only();
```

There are also inverse methods available (`WithoutMessage`, `WithoutErrorCode`, `WithoutSeverity`, `WithoutCustomState`).

## Asynchronous TestValidate

There is also an asynchronous `TestValidateAsync` method available which corresponds to the regular `ValidateAsync` method. Usage is similar, except the method returns an awaitable `Task` instead.

# Mocking

Validators are intended to be "black boxes" and we don't generally recommend mocking them. Within a test, the recommended approach is to supply a real validator instance with known bad data in order to trigger a validation error.

Mocking validators tends to require that you make assumptions about how the validators are built internally (both the rules contained within them, as well as FluentValidation's own internals). Mocking this behavior leads to brittle tests that aren't upgrade-safe.

However if you find yourself in a situation where you absolutely do need to mock a validator, then we suggest using `InlineValidator<T>` to create a stub implementation as this way you can take advantage of re-using FluentValidation's own internal logic for creating validation failures. We _strongly_ recommend not using a mocking library. An example of using `InlineValidator` is shown below:

```csharp
// Original validator that relies on an external service.
// External service is used to check that the customer ID is not already used in the database.
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer>
{
  public CustomerValidator(ICustomerRepository customerRepository)
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Id)
      .Must(id => customerRepository.CheckIdNotInUse(id));
  }
}

// If you needed to stub this failure in a unit/integration test,
// you could do the following:
var validator = new InlineValidator<Customer>();
validator.RuleFor(x => x.Id).Must(id => false);

// This instance could then be passed into anywhere expecting an IValidator<Customer>
```


## transform.md

# Transforming Values

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  The methods documented below are no longer recommended or supported and will be removed in FluentValidation 12. We instead recommend using computed properties on your model if you need to perform a transformation. For details please see `this GitHub issue <https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2072>`_
```

As of FluentValidation 9.5, you can apply a transformation to a property value prior to validation being performed against it. For example, if you have property of type `string` that actually contains numeric input, you could apply a transformation to convert the string value to a number.


```csharp
Transform(from: x => x.SomeStringProperty, to: value => int.TryParse(value, out int val) ? (int?) val : null)
    .GreaterThan(10);
```

This rule transforms the value from a `string` to a nullable `int` (returning `null` if the value couldn't be converted). A greater-than check is then performed on the resulting value.

Syntactically this is not particularly nice to read, so the logic for the transformation can optionally be moved into a separate method:

```csharp
Transform(x => x.SomeStringProperty, StringToNullableInt)
    .GreaterThan(10);

int? StringToNullableInt(string value)
  => int.TryParse(value, out int val) ? (int?) val : null;

```

This syntax is available in FluentValidation 9.5 and newer.

There is also a `TransformForEach` method available, which performs the transformation against each item in a collection.


## upgrading-to-8.md

# 8.0 Upgrade Guide

### Introduction

FluentValidation 8.0 is a major release that included several breaking changes. Please review this document before upgrading from FluentValidation 7.x to 8.

### Asynchronous Validation updates

There have been several major underlying changes to the asynchronous validation workflow in FluentValidation 8. These should not have any impact to any existing asynchronous code other than that some methods now take a `CancellationToken` when they didn't before.

These changes were made to remove the internal dependency on the old Microsoft `TaskHelper` classes and use `async/await` instead.

### SetCollectionValidator is deprecated

Instead of using `SetCollectionValidator` you should use FluentValidation's `RuleForEach` support instead:

FluentValidation 7:
```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.AddressLines).SetCollectionValidator(new AddressLineValidator());
```

FluentValidation 8:
```csharp
RuleForEach(x => x.AddressLines).SetValidator(new AddressLineValidator());
```

#### Why was this done?

`SetCollectionValidator` was added to FluentValidation in its initial versions to provide a way to use a child validator against each element in a collection. `RuleForEach` was added later and provides a more comprehensive way of validating collections (as you can define in-line rules with RuleForEach too). It doesn't make sense to provide 2 ways to do the same thing.

### Several properties have been removed from PropertyValidator

`CustomStateProvider`, `Severity`, `ErrorMessageSource` and `ErrorCodeSource` are no longer directly exposed on `PropertyValidator`, you should now access them via the `Options` property on `PropertyValidator` instead.

#### Why was this done?

It allows extra options/configuration to be added to property validators without introducing breaking changes to the interface going forward.

### ValidatorAttribute and AttributedValidatorFactory have been moved to a separate package

Use of the `ValidatorAttribute` to wire up validators is no longer recommended and have been moved to a separate `FluentValidation.ValidatorAttribute` package.

- In ASP.NET Core projects, you should use the service provider to wire models to their validators (this has been the default behaviour for ASP.NET Core projects since FluentValidation 7)
- For desktop or mobile applications, we recommend using an IoC container to wire up validators, although you can still use the attribute approach by explicitly installing the `FluentValidation.ValidatorAttribute` package.
- In legacy ASP.NET projects (MVC 5 and WebApi 2), the ValidatorAttribute is still the default approach, and the `FluentValidation.ValidatorAttribute` package will be automatically installed for compatibility. However, we recommend using an IoC container instead if you can.

### Validating properties by path

You can now validate specific properties using a full path, eg:

```csharp
validator.Validate(customer, "Address.Line1", "Address.Line2");
```

### Validating a specific ruleset with SetValidator

Previously, if you defined a child validator with `SetValidator`, then whichever ruleset you invoked on the parent validator will cascade to the child validator.
Now you can explicitly define which ruleset will run on the child:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Address).SetValidator(new AddressValidator(), "myRuleset");
```

### Many old and deprecated methods have been removed

FluentValidation 8 removes many old/deprecated methods that have been marked as obsolete for a long time.

- Removed the pre-7 way of performing custom validation (`Custom` and `CustomAsync`). Use `RuleFor(x => x).Custom()` instead. [See the section on Custom Validators](/custom-validators)
- The old localization mechanism that was deprecated with the release of FluentValidation 7. This included several overloads of `WithLocalizedName` and `WithLocalizedMessage`. [See the section on localization for more details](/localization).
- The `RemoveRule`, `ReplaceRule` and `ClearRules` methods that have been marked obsolete for many years (FluentValidation does not offer a replacement for these as runtime modification of validation rules is not recommended or supported in any way)
- Removed various async method overloads that didn't accept a `CancellationToken` (use the overloads that do accept them instead.)

### Other changes
`IStringSource.GetString` now receives a context, instead of a model. If you have custom `IStringSource` implementations, you will need to update them.



## upgrading-to-9.md

# 9.0 Upgrade Guide

### Introduction

FluentValidation 9.0 is a major release that included several breaking changes. Please review this document before upgrading from FluentValidation 8.x to 9.

### Supported Platforms

Support for the following platforms has been dropped:
- netstandard1.1
- netstandard1.6
- net45

FluentValidation still supports netstandard2 and net461, meaning that it'll run on .NET Core 2.0 or higher (3.1 recommended), or .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher.

FluentValidation.AspNetCore requires .NET Core 2.1 or 3.1 (3.1 recommended).

Integration with MVC5/WebApi 2 is no longer supported - both the FluentValidation.Mvc5 and FluentValidation.WebApi packages were deprecated with the release of FluentValidation 8, but they will now no longer receive further updates. They will continue to run on .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher, but we recommend migrating to .NET Core as soon as possible.

### Default Email Validation Mode Changed

FluentValidation supports 2 methods for validating email addresses.

The first is compatible with .NET Core's `EmailAddressAttribute` and performs a simple check that an email address contains an `@` character. The second uses a regular expression that is mostly compatible with .NET 4.x's `EmailAddressAttribute`, which also used a regular expression.

In FluentValidation 8 and older, the regex-based email validation was the default. As of 9.0, the ASP.NET Core-compatible email validator is now the default. This change was made to be consistent with ASP.NET Core's default behaviour.

If you still want to validate email addresses using the old regular expression, you can specify `RuleFor(customer => customer.Email).EmailAddress(EmailValidationMode.Net4xRegex);`. This will give a deprecation warning.

[See the documentation on the email validator](built-in-validators.html#email-validator) for more details on why regular expressions shouldn't be used for validating email addresses.

### TestHelper updates

The TestHelper has been updated with several syntax improvements. It is now possible to chain additional assertions on to `ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor` and `ShouldNotHaveValidationErrorFor`, eg:

```csharp
var validator = new InlineValidator<Person>();
validator.RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage("required");
validator.RuleFor(x => x.Address.Line1).NotEqual("foo");

// New advanced test syntax
var result = validator.TestValidate(new Person { Address = new Address()) };
result.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor(x => x.Surname).WithMessage("required");
result.ShouldNotHaveValidationErrorFor(x => x.Address.Line1);
```

[See the documentation for full details on the Test Helper](testing)

### Equal/NotEqual string comparisons

FluentValidation 4.x-8.x contained a bug where using `NotEqual`/`Equal` on string properties would perform a culture-specific check, which would lead to unintented results. 9.0 reverts the bad change which introduced this several years ago. An ordinal string comparison will now be performed instead.

[See the documentation for further details.](built-in-validators.html#equal-validator)

### Removal of non-generic Validate overload

The `IValidator.Validate(object model)` overload has been removed to improve type safety. If you were using this method before, you can use the overload that accepts an `IValidationContext` instead:

```csharp
var context = new ValidationContext<object>(model);
var result = validator.Validate(context);
```

### Removal of non-generic ValidationContext.

The non-generic `ValidationContext` has been removed. Anywhere that previously used this class will either accept a `ValidationContext<T>` or a non-generic `IValidationContext` interface instead. If you previously made use of this class in custom code, you will need to update it to use one of these as appropriate.

### Transform updates

The `Transform` method can now be used to transform a property value to a different type prior to validation occurring. [See the documentation for further details.](transform)

### Severity with callback

Prior to 9.0, changing a rule's severity required hard-coding the severity:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithSeverity(Severity.Warning);
```

Alternatively, this can now be generated from a callback, allowing the severity to be dynamically determined:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithSeverity(x => Severity.Warning);
```

### Changes to the ScalePrecisionValidator

The algorithm used by the `ScalePrecision` validator has been updated to match SQL Server and other RDBMS systems. The algorithm now correctly checks how many digits are to the left of the decimal point, which it didn't do before. 

### ChildValidatorAdaptor and IncludeRule now have generic parameters

The `ChildvalidatorAdaptor` and `IncludeRule` classes now have generic type parameters. This will not affect users of the public API, but may affect anyone using the internal API. 

### Removed inferring property names from [Display] attribute

Older versions of FluentValidation allowed inferring a property's name from the presence of the `[Display]` or `[DisplayName]` attributes on the property. This behaviour has been removed as it causes conflicts with ASP.NET Core's approach to localization using these attributes.

If you want to preserve this old behaviour, you can use a custom display name resolver which can be set during your application's startup routine:

```csharp
FluentValidation.ValidatorOptions.DisplayNameResolver = (type, memberInfo, expression) => {
	return memberInfo.GetCustomAttribute<System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.DisplayAttribute>()?.GetName();
};
```

### ComparisonProperty formatting

The `{ComparisonProperty}` error message placeholder (used in various validators that compare two properties, such as `LessThanOrEqual`) is now formatted consistently with the `{PropertyName}` placeholder, so PascalCased property names will be split.

### Renamed ShouldValidateAsync

Renamed the `PropertyValidator.ShouldValidateAsync` method to `ShouldValidateAsynchronously` to indicate that this is not an async method, which is usually denoted by the Async suffix.

### Removal of WithLocalizedMessage

This is only relevant if you use RESX-based localization with strongly-typed wrapper classes generated by Visual Studio. Older versions of FluentValidation allowed the use of specifying a resource name and resource type in a call to `WithLocalizedMessage`:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithLocalizedMessage(typeof(MyLocalizedMessages), "SurnameRequired");
```

This syntax has been superceded by the callback syntax. To access the localized messages with a strongly-typed wrapper, you should now explicitly access the wrapper property inside a callback:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotNull().WithMessage(x => MyLocalizedMessages.SurnameRequired);
```

Note that support for localization with `IStringLocalizer` is unchanged.

[Full documentation on localization.](localization)

### SetCollectionValidator removed

`SetCollectionValidator` has been removed. This was [deprecated in 8.0](upgrading-to-8).

### Removal of Other Deprecated Features

Several other methods/properties that were deprecated in FluentValidation 8 have been removed in 9.0.

- `ReplacePlaceholderWithValue` and `GetPlaceholder` from `MesageFormatter`
- `ResourceName` and `ResourceType` have been removed from `IStringSource`.
- `ResourceName` has been removed from `ValidationFailure`.
- `Instance` was removed from `PropertyValidatorContext` - use `InstanceToValidate` instead.
- `DelegatingValidator` has been removed
- `FluentValidation.Internal.Comparer` has been removed
- `FluentValidation.Internal.TrackingCollection` is now internal



## upgrading-to-10.md

# 10.0 Upgrade Guide

### Introduction

FluentValidation 10.0 is a major release that included several breaking changes. Please review this document carefully before upgrading from FluentValidation 9.x to 10.

The main goals for this release were to improve performance and type safety. To achieve this we have introduced generics throughout FluentValidation's internal model. If you have written custom property validators, or made use of the internal API then you will need to update your code. Users of the public-facing API and fluent interface will be largely unaffected.

### PropertyValidatorContext Deprecated

The `PropertyValidatorContext` class has been deprecated, and various places that previously used this now receive a `ValidationContext<T>` instead. Anywhere that previously called `context.ParentContext` to access the `ValidationContext<T>` can now just use `context` instead. For example:


```csharp
// Before:
RuleFor(x => x.Foo).Must((instance, value, context) => 
{
  return context.ParentContext.RootContextData.ContainsKey("Something");
});

// After:
RuleFor(x => x.Foo).Must((instance, value, context) => 
{
  return context.RootContextData.ContainsKey("Something");
});
```

### Custom Property Validators

Custom property validators are now generic, and inherit from either `PropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` or `AsyncPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>`. Property validators that inherit from the old non-generic `PropertyValidator` class will continue to work for now, but you will receive a deprecation warning. We recommend migrating to the new generic classes for better performance and support going forward. The non-generic version will be removed in FluentValidation 11. If you currently inherit from `AsyncValidatorBase` then you'll need to migrate as part of upgrading to 10.0

The following changes should be made in order to migrate:
- The class should inherit from `PropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` (or `AsyncPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>`)
- The method signature for `IsValid` should be updated
- The method signature for `GetDefaultMessageTemplate` should be updated
- The `Name` property should be overridden.

The following example shows a custom property validator before and after migration.

```csharp
// Before:
public class NotNullValidator : PropertyValidator
{
  protected override bool IsValid(PropertyValidatorContext context)
  {
    return context.PropertyValue != null;
  }

  protected override string GetDefaultMessageTemplate()
    => "A value for {PropertyName} is required";
}

// After:
public class NotNullValidator<T,TProperty> : PropertyValidator<T, TProperty>
{
  public override string Name => "NotNullValidator";

  public override bool IsValid(ValidationContext<T> context, TProperty value)
  {
    return value != null;
  }

  protected override string GetDefaultMessageTemplate(string errorCode)
    => "A value for {PropertyName} is required";
}
```

### ValidationResult.Errors type change 

The `Errors` property on the `ValidationResult` class has been changed from `IList<ValidationFailure>` to `List<ValidationFailure>`. 

### Changes to property validator metadata

In previous versions of FluentValidation, a property validator's configuration and the property validator itself were part of the same class (`PropertyValidator`). In FluentValidation 10, these are now separate. The validator itself that performs the work is either an `IPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` or an `IAsyncPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` and their configuration is exposed via a `RuleComponent`. Note there is still a non-generic `IPropertyValidator` interface available implemented by both `IPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` and `IAsyncPropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` but it has fewer properties available.

Various methods and properties that previously returned an `IPropertyValidator` now return a tuple of `(IPropertyValidator Validator, IRuleComponent Options)` where previously they returned an `IPropertyValidator`:

- `IValidatorDescriptor.GetMembersWithValidators`
- `IValidatorDescriptor.GetValidatorsForMember`

When accessing property validators via a rule instance, you must now go via a collection of components:

```csharp
// Before:
IValidationRule rule = ...;
foreach (IPropertyValidator propertyValidator in rule.Validators) 
{
  // ...
}

// After:
IValidationRule rule = ...;
foreach (IRuleComponent component in rule.Componetnts) 
{
  IPropertyValiator propertyValidator = component.Validator;
}
```

When accessing the current property validator instance on a rule, you must now go via the `Current` property to get the component first.

```csharp
// before:
PropertyRule rule = ...;
IPropertyValidator currentValidator = rule.CurrentValidator;

// after:
IValidationRule<T,TProperty> rule = ...;
RuleComponent<T, TProperty> component = rule.Current;
IPropertyValidator currentValidator = component.CurrentValidator;
```

### Transform syntax changes

The old `Transform` syntax has been removed. See [https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/transform.html](transform)

### DI changes

Validators are now registered as `Scoped` rather than `Transient` when using the ASP.NET integration.

### Changes to Interceptors

`IValidatorInterceptor` and `IActionContextValidatorInterceptor` have been combined.
The methods in `IValidatorInterceptor` now accept an `ActionContext` as their first parameter instead of a `ControllerContext`, and `IActionContextValidatorInterceptor` has been removed.

### Changes to ASP.NET client validator adaptors

The signature for adding an ASP.NET Client Validator factories has changed to receive a rule component instead of a property validator. Additionally, as property validator instances are now generic, the lookup key should be a non-generic interface implemented by the property validator.

```csharp

// Before:
public class MyCustomClientsideAdaptor : ClientValidatorBase
{
  public MyCustomClientsideAdaptor(PropertyRule rule, IPropertyValidator validator)
  : base(rule, validator)
  {

  }

  public override void AddValidation(ClientModelValidationContext context)
  {
    // ...
  }
}

services.AddMvc().AddFluentValidation(fv =>
{
  fv.ConfigureClientsideValidation(clientSide =>
  {
    clientSide.Add(typeof(MyCustomPropertyValidator), (context, rule, validator) => new MyCustomClientsideAdaptor(rule, validator));
  })
})


// after:
public class MyCustomClientsideAdaptor : ClientValidatorBase
{
  public MyCustomClientsideAdaptor(IValidationRule rule, IRuleComponent component)
  : base(rule, component)
  {

  }

  public override void AddValidation(ClientModelValidationContext context)
  {
    // ...
  }
}

services.AddMvc().AddFluentValidation(fv =>
{
  fv.ConfigureClientsideValidation(clientSide =>
  {
    clientSide.Add(typeof(IMyCustomPropertyValidator), (context, rule, component) => new MyCustomClientsideAdaptor(rule, component));
  })
})

```

### The internal API

Parts of FluentValidation's internal API have been marked as `internal` which were previously public. This has been done to allow us to evolve and change the internal model going forward. The following classes are affected:

- `RuleBuilder`
- `PropertyRule`
- `CollectionPropertyRule`
- `IncludeRule`

For the majority of cases, if you accessed these classes directly in your code you should be able to use our metadata interfaces to achieve the same result. These include the following:

- `IValidationRule`
- `IValidationRule<T>`
- `IValidationRule<T,TProperty>`
- `ICollectionRule<T, TElement>`
- `IIncludeRule`

Additionally the following methods have been removed from rule instances:
- `RemoveValidator`
- `ReplaceValidator`

### Removal of deprecated code

Several classes, interfaces and methods that were deprecated in FluentValidation 9 and have now been removed:

Related to the generation of error messages, the following have been removed. Alternative methods that receive callbacks are available instead:

- `IStringSource`
- `LazyStringSource`
- `LanguageStringSource`
- `StaticStringSource`

The following additional unused classes and interfaces have been removed:
- `Language`
- `ICommonContext`

The following methods and properties have been removed:
- `ValidationFailure.FormattedMessageArguments`
- `MessageFormatter.AppendAdditionalArguments`
- `MemberNameValidatorSelector.FromExpressions`
- Various utility and extension methods that were previously used throughout the internal API, such as `CooerceToNonGeneric`

Several extension methods that provided overloads of the `Validate` method that were previously deprecated have been removed. Replacements are available:

```csharp
// Validating only specific properties.
// Before:
validator.Validate(instance, x => x.SomeProperty, x => x.SomeOtherProperty);
validator.Validate(instance, "SomeProperty", "SomeOtherProperty");

// After:
validator.Validate(instance, v =>
{
  v.IncludeProperties(x => x.SomeProperty, x => x.SomeOtherProperty);
});

validator.Validate(instance, v =>
{
  v.IncludeProperties("SomeProperty", "SomeOtherProperty");
});

// Validating by ruleset:
// Before (comma-delmited string to separate multiple rulesets):
validator.Validate(instance, ruleSet: "SomeRuleSet,AnotherRuleSet");

// After:
// Separate parameters for each ruleset.
validator.Validate(instance, v => 
{
  v.IncludeRuleSets("SomeRuleSet", "AnotherRuleSet")
});

```

### Other changes

- `ChildValidatorAdaptor.GetValidator` is non-generic again (as it was in FV 8.x)
- The `RuleSets` property on `IValidationRule` instances can now be null. In previous versions this would be initialized to an empty array.


## upgrading-to-11.md


# 11.0 Upgrade Guide

### Introduction

FluentValidation 11.0 is a major release that included several breaking changes. Please review this document carefully before upgrading from FluentValidation 10.x to 11.

There were 3 main goals for this release:
- Removing deprecated code and support for obsolete platforms
- Update sync-over-async workflows to clearly throw an exception
- Remove ambiguity in handling of `CascadeMode` settings

Below is a summary of all the changes in this release:

### Changes in supported platforms

- .NET Core 2.1 is no longer supported as Microsoft has stopped support for this platform.

### Sync-over-async now throws an exception

In FluentValidation 10.x and older, if you attempted to run an asynchronous validator synchronously, the asynchronous rules would silently be run synchronously. This was unintutive and would lead to deadlocks. 

Starting in FluentValidation 11.0, validators that contain asynchronous rules will now throw a `AsyncValidatorInvokedSynchronouslyException` if you attempt to invoke them synchronously. You must invoke these validators asynchronously.

This affects rules that contain any of the following:
- Calls to `MustAsync`
- Calls to `WhenAsync` and `UnlessAsync`
- Calls to `CustomAsync`
- Use of any custom async validators 

### OnFailure and OnAnyFailure removed

The deprecated methods `OnFailure` and `OnAnyFailure` have been removed.

These were callbacks that could be used to define an action that would be called when a particular rule fails. These methods were deprecated in 10.x as they allowed the standard FluentValidation workflow to be bypassed, and additionally they have caused various maintenance issues since they were introduced. 

If you were previously using `OnFailure` or `OnAnyFailure` to perform custom logic after validation, we recommend using a `Custom` validator instead.

### Test Helper changes

The deprecated extension methods `validator.ShouldHaveValidationErrorFor` and `validator.ShouldNotHaveValidationErrorFor` have been removed. The recommended alternative is to use `TestValidate` instead, [which is covered in the documentation here](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/testing.html).

### Cascade Mode Changes

The `CascadeMode` properties on `AbstractValidator` and `ValidatorOptions.Global` have been deprecated and replaced with the properties `RuleLevelCascadeMode` and `ClassLevelCascadeMode` which provide finer-grained control for setting the cascade mode.

If you are currently setting `ValidatorOptions.Global.CascadeMode` to `Continue` or `Stop`, you can simply replace this with

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
```

If you are currently setting it to `StopOnFirstFailure`, replace it with

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Continue; // Not actually needed as this is the default. Just here for completeness.
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;
```

Similarly, if you are currently setting `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` to `Continue` or `Stop`, replace this with

```csharp
ClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
```

If you are currently setting it to `StopOnFirstFailure`, replace it with

```csharp
ClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Continue;
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;
```

If you are calling `.Cascade(CascadeMode.StopOnFirstFailure)` in a rule chain, replace `StopOnFirstFailure` with `Stop` (this has always had the same behavior at rule-level since `Stop` was introduced anyway).

All of the changes described above are exactly what the code does now anyway - e.g. if you set `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` to `Stop`, it sets `AbstractValidator.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode` and `AbstractValidator.DefaultClassLevelCascadeMode` to `Stop`, and doesn't use `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` in any logic internally.

You may also be able to remove some now-unneeded calls to `.Cascade` at rule-level. For example, if you have the cascade mode at validator class-level set to `Continue`, and are repeating `.Cascade(CascadeMode.Stop[/StopOnFirstFailure])` for each rule, you can now replace this with

```csharp
ClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Continue;
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;
```

...or their global default equivalents. 

 See [this page in the documentation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/conditions.html#setting-the-cascade-mode) for details of how cascade modes work.

As `StopOnFirstFailure` is deprecated and scheduled for removal, it cannot be assigned to either of the two new `AbstractValidator` properties or their global equivalents (it still can be assigned to the also-deprecated `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode`). Attempting to set the new properties to `StopOnFirstFailure` will simply result in `Stop` being used instead.

### MessageBuilder changes

If you use the `MessageBuilder` functionality to provide custom logic for error message creation then please note that as of 11.0 you can only have a single `MessageBuilder` associated with a rule chain. This property is also now set-only. In previous versions you may have had code like this:

```csharp
return ruleBuilder.Configure(rule => {
  var originalMessageBuilder = rule.MessageBuilder;
  rule.MessageBuilder = context => {
    
    // ... some custom logic in here.
    
    return originalMessageBuilder?.Invoke(context) ?? context.GetDefaultMessage();
  };
});
```

Now as this property is set-only you'll need to update it to remove references to `originalMessageBuilder`:

```csharp
return ruleBuilder.Configure(rule => {
  rule.MessageBuilder = context => {
    // ... some custom logic in here.
    return context.GetDefaultMessage();
  };
});
```

This means you can no longer chain MessageBuilders together, and whichever one is set last will be the only one associated with the rule, so please confirm that you aren't relying on the previous behaviour before making this change. 


### ASP.NET Core Integration changes

The deprecated property `RunDefaultMvcValidationAfterFluentValidationExecutes` within the ASP.NET Configuration has been removed. 

If you were making use of this property, you should use `DisableDataAnnotationsValidation` instead. Note that this property is the inverse of the previous behaviour:

```csharp
// Before:
services.AddFluentValidation(fv => {
  fv.RunDefaultMvcValidationAfterFluentValidationExecutes = false;
});

// After:
services.AddFluentValidation(fv => {
  fv.DisableDataAnnotationsValidation = true;
});

```

### Removal of backwards compatibility property validator layer

The non-generic `PropertyValidator` class (and associated classes/helpers) have been removed. These classes were deprecated in 10.0. If you are still using this class, you should migrate to the generic `PropertyValidator<T,TProperty>` instead. 

### Internal API Changes

Several of the methods in the Internal API have been removed. These changes don't affect use of the public fluent interface, but may impact library developers or advanced users.

- `IValidationRule<T,TProperty>.CurrentValidator` has been removed (use the `Current` property instead)
-`IValidationRule<T,TProperty>.Current` now returns an `IRuleComponent<T,TProperty>` interface instead of `RuleComponent<T,TProperty>` (necessary to support variance) 
-`IValidationRule<T,TProperty>.MessageBuilder`'s argument is now an `IMessageBuilderContext<T,TProperty>` interface instead of `MessageBuilderContext<T,TProperty>` class (necessary to support variance)
- `IValidationRule<T,TProperty>.MessageBuilder` is now set-only, and has no getter exposed (needed to support variance), meaning you can only have one message builder per rule chain. 
- `IRuleComponent<T,TProperty>.CustomStateProvider` is now set-only to support variance
- `IRuleComponent<T,TProperty>.SeverityProvider` is now set-only to support variance
- `GetErrorMessage` is no longer exposed on `IRuleComponent<T,TProperty>`
- Remove deprecated `Options` property from `RuleComponent`
- The `MemberAccessor` class has been removed as it's no longer used


## upgrading-to-12.md

# 12.0 Upgrade Guide

### Introduction

FluentValidation 12.0 is a major release that included several breaking changes. Please review this document carefully before upgrading from FluentValidation 11.x to 12.

The main goal of this release was removal of deprecated code and removal of support for obsolete platforms. There are no new features in this release.

### Changes in supported platforms

Support for the following platforms has been removed:

- .NET Core 3.1 (Microsoft's support ended in December 2022)
- .NET 5 (Microsoft's support ended in November 2022)
- .NET 6 (Microsoft's support ended in November 2024)
- .NET 7 (Microsoft's support ended in November 2024)
- .NET Standard 2.0/2.1

.NET 8 is now the minimum supported version.

If you still need .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility then you will need to continue to use FluentValidation 11.x and only upgrade to FluentValidation 12 once you've moved to a more modern version of .NET.  

### Removal of the Transform and TransformForEach methods

The `Transform` and `TransformForEach` methods deprecated in 11.x have been removed. For details on how to migrate see [https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2072](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2072)

### Removal of CascadeMode.StopOnFirstFailure

The `StopOnFirstFailure` cascade option was deprecated in FluentValidation 11.0 and has now been removed, along with the `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` and `ValidatorOptions.Global.CascadeMode` properties which were also deprecated in 11.0. 

If were previously setting `ValidatorOptions.Global.CascadeMode` to `Continue` or `Stop`, you can simply replace this with the following:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
```

If you were previously setting it to `StopOnFirstFailure`, replace it with the following:

```csharp
ValidatorOptions.Global.DefaultRuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;
```

Similarly, if you were previously setting `AbstractValidator.CascadeMode` to `Continue` or `Stop`, replace this with the following:

```csharp
ClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.<YourCurrentValue>;
```

If you were previously setting it to `StopOnFirstFailure`, replace it with the following:

```csharp
ClassLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Continue;
RuleLevelCascadeMode = CascadeMode.Stop;
```

If you were calling `.Cascade(CascadeMode.StopOnFirstFailure)` in a rule chain, replace `StopOnFirstFailure` with `Stop`.

### Removal of InjectValidator and related methods

The `InjectValidator` method was deprecated in 11.x and removed in 12.0.

This method allowed you to implicitly inject a child validator from the ASP.NET Service Provider:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator() 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Address).InjectValidator();
  }
}
```

Assuming that the address property is of type `Address`, the above code would attempt to resolve an `IValidator<Address>` and use this to validator the `Address` property. This method can only be used when working with ASP.NET MVC's auto-validation feature and cannot be used in other contexts. 

Instead of using `InjectValidator`, you should instead use a more traditional constructor injection approach, which is not just limited to ASP.NET MVC:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> 
{
  public PersonValidator(IValidator<Address> addressValidator) 
  {
    RuleFor(x => x.Address).SetValidator(addressValidator);
  }
}
```

### Removal of AbstractValidator.EnsureInstanceNotNull

In previous versions of FluentValidation it was possible to override the `AbstractValidator.EnsureInstanceNotNull` method to disable FluentValidation's root-model null check. The ability to do this was deprecated in 11.5.x and has now been removed. For further details please see [https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2069](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2069)


### Changes to the Serbian language translations

The existing Serbian translations have been renamed to Serbian (Latin) and are now available under the `sr-Latn` language code. A new Serbian (Cyrillic) language has been added, which is now the default for the `sr` language code. 


### Other breaking API changes 

- The `ITestValidationContinuation` interface now exposes a `MatchedFailures` property (as well as the existing `UnmatchedFailures`)
- The `ShouldHaveAnyValidationError` method has been renamed to `ShouldHaveValidationErrors`
- `ShouldNotHaveAnyValidationErrors` and `ShouldHaveValidationErrors` are now instance methods on `TestValidationResult`, instead of extension methods.
